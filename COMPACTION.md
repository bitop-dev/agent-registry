# COMPACTION

## Repo

`agent-registry` owns the plugin registry server.

It does not own:

- the core CLI/runtime (`../agent`)
- the package bundles themselves (`../agent-plugins`)

## Status

There is already a first working scaffold.

Implemented:

- scan plugin packages from `../agent-plugins`
- serve `/healthz`
- serve `/v1/index.json`
- serve package/version metadata
- generate and serve `.tar.gz` artifacts

## Current next step

Harden the server a bit, then let `../agent` consume it for remote search/install.

Priority:

1. stronger tests, especially artifact download
2. richer metadata
3. then core CLI integration in `../agent`

## Important docs

- `WHERE-WE-ARE.md`
- `README.md`
- `docs/plugin-registry-contract.md`
- `docs/plugin-registry-server-plan.md`
- `docs/registry-server-build-guide.md`

## Quick commands

```bash
go test ./...
go run ./cmd/registry-server --plugin-root ../agent-plugins --addr 127.0.0.1:9080
```

Goal
Continue Phase 1 after v0.1.0 by evolving the plugin ecosystem toward a real package/registry model:
- keep local plugin installs always supported
- support configurable plugin sources
- build a separate plugin package repo (agent-plugins)
- build a separate registry server repo (agent-registry)
- next major implementation goal is remote plugins search / later plugins install from the registry server
Also make repo handoff/context-switching easier with WHERE-WE-ARE.md and COMPACTION.md files in each repo.
Instructions
- Local install should always be supported.
- The user wants a future plugin ecosystem similar to npm/Homebrew/Terraform Registry.
- The user wants the registry server code, docs, roadmap, etc. in /Users/nickcecere/Projects/GOLANG/agent-registry, not in agent or agent-plugins.
- The user explicitly wanted detailed design/build docs so other coding agents can work in parallel.
- The user asked for WHERE-WE-ARE.md and compact summary docs in all three repos so they can switch directories without losing context.
Discoveries
- v0.1.0 was successfully tagged and pushed from agent.
- Secrets were rotated externally per user, so Phase 0 release blockers were treated as closed.
- agent-plugins and agent-registry are currently just directories, not git repos.
- The core repo agent is a git repo and has recent uncommitted/then committed Phase 1 work.
- Plugin bundles were successfully moved out of agent/_testing/plugins into /Users/nickcecere/Projects/GOLANG/agent-plugins.
- Plugin-owned example profiles were moved out of agent/_testing/profiles into matching packages under agent-plugins/.../examples/profiles/.
- Framework-owned profiles remain in agent/_testing/profiles/.
- Framework test runtimes remain in agent/_testing/runtimes/ for now.
- MCP support was expanded earlier to cover stdio, remote HTTP, and SSE; this is already committed in agent.
- The user has an existing Context7 MCP setup, which led to remote MCP support being added earlier.
- A practical first registry abstraction already exists in agent:
  - pluginSources in config
  - plugins sources add/list/remove
  - plugins search for filesystem sources
  - install by plugin name from configured filesystem sources
  - registry sources can be configured, but remote search/install is not implemented yet
- agent-registry now contains a first working registry server scaffold:
  - scans ../agent-plugins
  - serves /healthz
  - serves /v1/index.json
  - serves /v1/packages/{name}.json
  - serves /v1/packages/{name}/{version}.json
  - generates and serves .tar.gz artifacts
- The registry server was run and validated against those endpoints locally.
- The user asked to pause and move registry work from agent-plugins/registry into a dedicated sibling repo agent-registry; that move was performed.

  - plugins sources remove
- Added plugins search [query] across configured filesystem sources.
- Added install-by-name from configured filesystem sources.

- Added tests for source resolution and search.
- Committed these changes in agent:
  - commit 4c53a87
  - message: feat(plugin): add source search and handoff docs
Completed in registry planning/docs
- Wrote registry contract doc (now moved to agent-registry):
  - agent-registry/docs/plugin-registry-contract.md
- Wrote registry server implementation plan:
  - agent-registry/docs/plugin-registry-server-plan.md

- Created Go module:
  - agent-registry/go.mod

Completed for handoff/context switching
Added detailed and compact status docs in all three repos:
- agent/WHERE-WE-ARE.md
- agent/COMPACTION.md
- agent-plugins/WHERE-WE-ARE.md
- agent-plugins/COMPACTION.md
- agent-registry/WHERE-WE-ARE.md
- agent-registry/COMPACTION.md
Current status / in progress
- agent-registry has a working first scaffold, but needs hardening and then agent needs to consume it.
- The next logical implementation step is in agent:
  1. implement remote plugins search against GET /v1/index.json
  2. then remote plugins install <name> using package metadata + artifact download
Left to do next
- In agent:
  - implement remote plugins search for configured registry sources
  - later implement remote install and version/source recording
- In agent-registry:
  - add stronger tests, especially artifact download coverage
  - improve metadata richness
  - possibly add generated/cached index/artifact support under data/
- Optionally initialize agent-plugins and agent-registry as git repos if desired; they are not git repos yet.
